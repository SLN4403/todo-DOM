# To Do App 📝👩‍💻 
<p> A simple to do app I made in class while learning to understand and apply the use of javascript DOM more. </p>
<p> In this app, you can do such things like... </p>
<ul>
  <li> creating to-do lists </li>
  <li> editing some texts </li>
  <li> marking as done </li>
  <li> deleting </li>
</ul>
<p> just like every other basic type of to-do apps. </p>
